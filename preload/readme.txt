Hello Hacker! Welcome to you special edition GitHub Badger 2040.

The Badger 2040 is a hackable, programmable badge with E Ink® display,
powered by Raspberry Pi RP2040.

This special edition badge from GitHub was created in partnership with
Pimoroni. Electronically it's identical to the Badger 2040, but with added
sparkles.

However if you are poking around here in Thonny then why don't you try
editing some of the files here and see what happens.

This lanyard is a complete Raspberry Pi Pico dev board, if you want to
drop your own custom uf2 image on here then you can do that too and turn
this device into whatever you want.  You can expand your badge via the
Qwiic/STEMMA QT connector on the back.  We've also left some solder
points available if you wanted to add other components.

Can't wait to see what you build from here. Share your creations with us
on social @GitHub and @Pimoroni!

With love from everyone at the team here at GitHub - thanks for coming!
